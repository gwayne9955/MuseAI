        Welcome to MuseAI!
        
        MuseAI helps songwriters develop and store their melodies, with the help of artificial intelligence.
        
        Here you can create recordings with different instruments, save them, and play them back, \
        all while your recordings are safely stored on your device or in the cloud.
        
        This was developed as a part of my CSC Senior Project at Cal Poly, so please enjoy!
        
        
        Thanks,
        Garrett
